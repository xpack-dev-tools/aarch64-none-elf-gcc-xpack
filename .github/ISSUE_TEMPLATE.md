### Disclaimer

The xPack GNU Aarch64 Embedded GCC is only a binary distribution of
the [GNU Aarch64 Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain),
and does not intend to add new functionality, or to fix existing problems.

If you have questions/suggestions related to the procedure used to
build/publish the binary distribution, continue reading the next sections.

If you have problems related to Arm GCC functionality, please use the
official [Linaro bugzilla](https://bugs.linaro.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GNU%20Binary%20Toolchain/).
