The project was created in **April 2022**,
following Arm's reorganization of
the [Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain)
which resulted in a family of toolchains for bare metal AArch64 and AArch32 targets.

The build scripts were initially a copy/paste of the
[`arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/) project.

Both `aarch64-none-elf` and `arm-none-eabi` toolchains follow the Arm
releases schedule (which are usually one major version behind the GNU releases),
utilizing the same sources and similar build configurations as the
official Arm releases. They are designed to be fully compatible
with the official Arm GNU Toolchains.

### May 2022
